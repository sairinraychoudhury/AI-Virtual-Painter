# AI Virtual Painter

The AI Virtual Painter project is an application that utilizes geometric shapes, air-drawing, computer vision, NumPy, MediaPipe, and OpenCV. It integrates a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model.

"HandTrackingModule.py"  this module contains functions related to hand detection and tracking, allowing the application to interpret hand gestures or movements.

"VirtualPainter.py" this module is responsible for implementing the virtual painting functionality.

## Features

1. Adjustable eraser thickness.

2. Circle drawing functionality.

3. Rectangle drawing capability.

4. Ellipse drawing option.

5. Freehand writing capability.

6. Clear the entire screen with a simple two-finger gesture.

7. On-screen Brush Thickness Display.
   
## Tech Stack

Programming Language: Python

Libraries Used: OpenCV, Mediapipe and NumPy


## Getting Started

### Using the project:

1. Ensure to have Python installed on our system. 
Install required libraries using the following command:

      `pip install opencv-python`

      `pip install mediapipe` 

      `pip install numpy`

2. Run the Application:

Execute the main application script to launch the AI Virtual Painter.

      python VirtualPainter.py


3. Explore and Create:
   

Utilize the various features listed below to experiment with drawing geometric shapes and air-drawing.

1. Drawing Circle: Diameter of circle is decided using index finger and thumb. Circle is printed on screen by raising little finger.
   
2. Drawing Rectangle: Diagonal of rectangle is decided using index finger and thumb. Rectangle is printed on screen by raising little finger.

3. Drawing Ellipse: Diagonal of ellipse is decided using index finger and thumb. Ellipse is printed on screen by raising little finger.
   
4. Free hand style drawing: Is done using index figure and thumb.
   
5. Color Selection: Using index figure and middle figure.
   
6. Eraser: Increase eraser thickness using index finger and little finger.
